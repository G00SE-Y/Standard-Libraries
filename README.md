PURPOSE:
This is a project created with the intention of exploring and learning more about the C language and all of its intricacies as well as sharpening my coding skills.
This project is meant for purely educational use and is not to be used for any commerical purposes.
I'm really trying to challenge myself to learn more about coding in general, as well as how the C language and the gcc (or Chad C Compiler, AKA 3xC B^) ) compiler works internally.

GOALS:
The goal of this project is to rebuild some of the standard C libraries (and possibly make my own) with the use of only knowing the parameters and ouputs of all included functions.
I'm not limiting my research possiblities, but I am not allowing myself to look at any source code for the libraries in question.
